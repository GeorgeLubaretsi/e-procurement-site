In examining the outcome of the procurement may be more suspicious facts: 5
- The winning price is significantly higher than the price for a similar product from a recent tender
- The difference between the offer prices show some symmetry
- Came just one or a few offers, although the market there are many potential suppliers
- Came a lot of offers, but only one is real, the other did not meet the formal requirements or offer only
slightly lower price
- The winning prize is (almost) identical to the expected
- The winning bid has a high proportion of subcontracting (potentially for other participants in the cartel)
